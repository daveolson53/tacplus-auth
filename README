tacplus-auth v1.0.0
Oct 13, 2016

The user name for tacacs accounting is that returned by getpwuid()
with the uid returned by audit_getloginuid(), or if no auid, using
the real uid returned by getresuid().

It's expected this command will normally be used after login authenticated
via a tacacs server, and if the pam_tacplus plugin is used, the auid will
be set.

This program does not directly use the tacplus-map library, but when
libnss-tacplus is installed, that library and name lookup may be used.

Only the TACACS+ authorization  functions are used.

Up to 240 bytes of command name and command arguments will be sent
in the authorization record, due to the 255 byte tacacs+ field length
limitation.

The TACACS code here is based in the pam_tacplus plugin, written by
   Pawel Krawczyk <pawel.krawczyk@hush.com> and Jeroen Nijhof <jeroen@jeroennijhof.nl>

It is based on version pam_tacplus version 1.3.9.
It uses the libtac.so shared library from a modified libpam_tacplus
package.

There is no configuration file for this program, it uses /etc/tacplus_servers
for the list of servers and keys, and for debug.
tacplus-auth should be setuid root, so that the config file can be opened.

Privileges are dropped as soon as the configuration file is read.
